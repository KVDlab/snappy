# SNAPPy

This is the repository for SNAPPy, a Snakemake pipeline for HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing. SNAPPy allows high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping locally while being resource efficient and scalable. This pipeline was constructed using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) , and it uses [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) and for multiple sequence alignment, [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs) for similarirty querys, [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) for phylogenetic inference, and several [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) modules for data parsing an analysis. For in-depth information on how the tool works please visit the [documentation page](https://snappy-hiv1-subtyping.readthedocs.io). SNAPPy was design for Linux based operative systems.

## How to install

In the documentation page you can find a [Quick install Guide](https://snappy-hiv1-subtyping.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#quick-install-guide) and an [Install point-by-point](https://snappy-hiv1-subtyping.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-point-by-point) .

## How to use

SNAPPy usage is demonstrated in the documentations in SNAPPy commands, furthermnore the [Tutorials](https://snappy-hiv1-subtyping.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) section coins example on how to use SNAPPy.
